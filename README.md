## Intro
So what is this? It's basically a framework for [bolt](https://github.com/mcbeet/bolt). Featuring modules that allow you to accelerate your development process.

&nbsp;

This is so far a solo project. It has been in development for months, with hundreds of hours in.

I would genuinely be the happiest person ever to find out it helped someone out there. I put my heart into this one.

&nbsp;

Feedback is greatly appreciated!

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/reapermc/reaper_framework/releases/latest).
2. Extract the `zip` file inside of your project's `src/data`.
3. Create a starting point of your project with a `main.bolt` file inside of `<your_namespace>/modules/`

The finished product should look as such:

```
src
└─── data
     ├─── _                          
     │    ├─── functions   
     │    │    └─── reaper_framework
     │    └─── modules
     │         └─── reaper_framework
     │
     │ 
     └─── demo           <------ your project namespace
          └─── modules
               └─── main.bolt
```

## Final note

Huge thanks to the entire [Beet Discord](https://discord.gg/98MdSGMm8j) server for always providing me with the help and resources I needed in order to create this.
